# Neurophysiological correlates of cortical hierarchy across the lifespan

This repository contains code and data for processing, statistical analyses and visualization in support of the work "Neurophysiological correlates of cortical hierarchy across the lifespan" on biorxiv. doi: XXX.
Additionally, Code for preprocessing of MEG and MRI data, cortical thickness estimation as well as most of the time-series feature computation can be found here: https://github.com/chstier/Aging_timefeats. Further, the computed time-series features can be found here: https://osf.io/h43mz/.

## Data availability
Raw data can be obtained via: https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/ upon request and under specified conditions.

## Toolboxes
The complete analysis was performed using MATLAB R2018b, R2022b, Python3.11, RStudio 2023.03.0:

Most time-series features were computed using the hctsa toolbox (https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual). To obtain a parcellated map of cortical hierarchy and perform spin testing, we used the neuomaps toolbox (https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/). Visualization of features values along the human cortex were performed using the brainspace toolbox 0.1.4. (https://brainspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
